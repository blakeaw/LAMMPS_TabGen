# Program to generate tabulated potential/force files for 
# use in LAMMMPS
#
# Adjust relevant parameters and run to generate a tabulated file usable in LAMMPS
# Comes with directory "Potentials" which should be stored in the same directory as 
# this program (e.g. store both in users bin directory or standard path directory).  
# Extending:
#   Several Potentials are written and included. You can easily extend by adding new potentials
#   using existing ones as templates. Potential classes are stored in the "Potentials" directory
#   Class file names should be "PotentialClassName.py" 
#   For a potential/force that is a combination of
#   muliple potentials a class can be constructed like the one included
#   "LJ126_COULOMB" 
#	
# Mixing:
#   If your potential has parameters that are the result of
#   mixing others you can either
#   - Precompute the mixed values and give to SetParams
#   - Give the full mixing formula with values to SetParams
#     e.g. Assume LJ126 potential with epsilon1, epsilon2, sigma1, and sigma2.
#          Appy Berthelot mixing by using:
#          potential.SetParams(sqrt(epsilon1*epsilon2), (sigma1+sigma2)*0.5)

### Parameter setting

rhigh = 2.5
# Lower Bound
rlow = 0.50
#Number of points to take
npoints = 1000
#Initializes Potential object -- set to desired
potential = LJ126()
#set parameters of potential- adjust values and number of args as needed
potential.SetParams(1.0, 1.5)
#set the name of output file
outname = "LJ_sigma2.tab"
# tabulated file type/style line - Adjust as needed 
line = "N " + str(npoints)+" R "+str(rlow)+" "+str(rhigh)
## End of parameter setting

# Open up the file to write to
file_output = open(outname, "w")
# Add some stuff to file to format for LAMMPS tab file
file_output.write("START")
